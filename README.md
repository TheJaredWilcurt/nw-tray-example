# NW.js Tray app example

This is an example project showing how to set up a tray "only" app using NW.js.

Will work on Windows 7+, OSX 10.9+ and most Debian based Linux distros (such as Ububuntu). To target legacy OS's like XP+ and OSX 10.6+, change the `nw` version in the `package.json` to `0.14.7-sdk`.

## Run locally

1. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org)
